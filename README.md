# User Database

This repository contains the code for the "User" database. The database is designed to store information about users for a web application.

## Table Structure

The "User" database consists of the following table:

### users

| Field         | Type        | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| id            | INT         | Unique identifier for a user   |
| firstName     | VARCHAR     | First name of the user        |
| lastName      | VARCHAR     | Last name of the user         |
| mobileNumber  | VARCHAR     | Phone number of the user      |
| password      | VARCHAR     | Password of the user          |

## Usage

The database is intended to be used with a web application that requires user registration and login functionality. The "users" table stores basic user information such as their name, phone number, and password.

## Setup

To set up the "User" database, you will need to:

1. Install a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Create a new database named "User".
3. Create the "users" table with the specified structure.

You can then integrate this database with your web application to handle user registration and login processes.
